# Reasoning Capture System

## ðŸ§  What You Have Now

Your ReasoningBank **automatically detects and captures ALL types of reasoning** in conversations - not just code, but logical thinking, analysis, problem-solving, and decision-making.

## ðŸŽ¯ Reasoning Patterns Detected

### 1. **Logical Reasoning**
Detects: `because`, `therefore`, `thus`, `hence`, `as a result`

**Example:**
```
Q: "Why use async/await in JavaScript?"
A: "Because it makes asynchronous code easier to read. Therefore, 
   you can avoid callback hell and write cleaner code."

âœ“ Tagged: reasoning_logical
âœ“ Stored: Captures the causal reasoning
```

### 2. **Analytical Thinking**
Detects: `analyze`, `examine`, `consider`, `break down`

**Example:**
```
Q: "How should I structure this API?"
A: "Let's analyze the requirements. Consider the data flow, 
   examine the security needs, and break down the endpoints..."

âœ“ Tagged: reasoning_analytical
âœ“ Stored: Captures the analytical approach
```

### 3. **Sequential Thinking**
Detects: `first`, `then`, `next`, `finally`, `step by step`

**Example:**
```
Q: "How do I deploy this?"
A: "First, build the image. Then, push to registry. 
   Next, update the deployment. Finally, verify it's running."

âœ“ Tagged: reasoning_sequential
âœ“ Stored: Captures the step-by-step process
```

### 4. **Causal Reasoning**
Detects: `causes`, `leads to`, `results in`, `due to`

**Example:**
```
Q: "Why is my app slow?"
A: "Large bundle size causes slow load times. This leads to 
   poor user experience, which results in higher bounce rates."

âœ“ Tagged: reasoning_causal
âœ“ Stored: Captures cause-effect chains
```

### 5. **Problem-Solving**
Detects: `solution`, `solve`, `address`, `resolve`, `handle`

**Example:**
```
Q: "How do I handle this edge case?"
A: "The solution is to add validation. This solves the null 
   pointer issue and addresses the edge case properly."

âœ“ Tagged: reasoning_problem-solving
âœ“ Stored: Captures solution approach
```

### 6. **Decision-Making**
Detects: `choose`, `decide`, `option`, `tradeoff`, `pros and cons`

**Example:**
```
Q: "Should I use REST or GraphQL?"
A: "Let's consider the tradeoffs. REST is simpler but GraphQL 
   gives more flexibility. The decision depends on your use case."

âœ“ Tagged: reasoning_decision-making
âœ“ Stored: Captures decision process
```

### 7. **Deductive Reasoning**
Detects: `conclude`, `infer`, `deduce`, `implies`, `suggests`

**Example:**
```
Q: "What does this error mean?"
A: "The stack trace suggests a null reference. This implies the 
   object wasn't initialized. We can conclude the constructor failed."

âœ“ Tagged: reasoning_deductive
âœ“ Stored: Captures inference chain
```

### 8. **Comparative Analysis**
Detects: `compare`, `contrast`, `versus`, `different`, `similar`

**Example:**
```
Q: "Redis vs PostgreSQL for caching?"
A: "Let's compare them. Redis is faster for caching but PostgreSQL 
   offers more features. The contrast shows different use cases."

âœ“ Tagged: reasoning_comparative
âœ“ Stored: Captures comparison logic
```

### 9. **Strategic Thinking**
Detects: `strategy`, `plan`, `approach`, `method`, `technique`

**Example:**
```
Q: "How should we scale this?"
A: "The strategy is to use horizontal scaling. This approach 
   handles traffic spikes better than the alternative method."

âœ“ Tagged: reasoning_strategic
âœ“ Stored: Captures strategic planning
```

### 10. **Conceptual Understanding**
Detects: `concept`, `principle`, `theory`, `idea`, `notion`

**Example:**
```
Q: "Explain dependency injection"
A: "The core concept is inversion of control. This principle 
   allows loose coupling. The idea is to inject dependencies..."

âœ“ Tagged: reasoning_conceptual
âœ“ Stored: Captures conceptual explanation
```

## ðŸ“Š Difficulty Assessment

The system now automatically classifies difficulty based on reasoning complexity:

| Difficulty | Criteria | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Complex** | 3+ reasoning patterns OR core task | Multi-step solution with analysis |
| **Moderate** | 1-2 reasoning patterns | Explanation with some logic |
| **Simple** | No reasoning patterns | Basic factual Q&A |

## ðŸŽ® Examples of What Gets Captured

### Example 1: Pure Reasoning (No Code)

```
Q: "Why is microservices architecture popular?"

A: "Let's analyze this. First, microservices allow independent scaling, 
   which leads to better resource utilization. Second, they enable team 
   autonomy, because different teams can work on different services. 
   Therefore, development velocity increases. However, the tradeoff is 
   added complexity in orchestration."

Captured:
âœ“ reasoning_analytical ("analyze")
âœ“ reasoning_sequential ("first", "second")
âœ“ reasoning_causal ("leads to", "because")  
âœ“ reasoning_logical ("therefore")
âœ“ reasoning_decision-making ("tradeoff")

Difficulty: Complex (5 reasoning patterns)
Description: "Reasoning: analytical, sequential"
```

### Example 2: Problem-Solving with Steps

```
Q: "How do I fix this memory leak?"

A: "First, identify where objects are retained. Then, examine the 
   reference chain. This approach helps you find the root cause. 
   The solution is to break circular references."

Captured:
âœ“ reasoning_sequential ("first", "then")
âœ“ reasoning_problem-solving ("fix", "solution")
âœ“ reasoning_strategic ("approach")
âœ“ reasoning_causal ("root cause")

Difficulty: Complex (4 reasoning patterns)
```

### Example 3: Decision with Tradeoffs

```
Q: "Should I use TypeScript?"

A: "Consider the pros and cons. TypeScript provides type safety, 
   which prevents many bugs. However, it adds compilation overhead. 
   The decision depends on project size - larger projects benefit more."

Captured:
âœ“ reasoning_decision-making ("pros and cons", "decision")
âœ“ reasoning_analytical ("consider")
âœ“ reasoning_causal ("prevents", "depends on")
âœ“ reasoning_comparative ("larger projects")

Difficulty: Complex (4 reasoning patterns)
```

### Example 4: Simple Factual

```
Q: "What port does HTTP use?"
A: "HTTP uses port 80."

Captured:
âœ— No reasoning patterns

Difficulty: Simple
NOT stored (too basic)
```
